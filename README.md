# SolarSystemSimulation
A small solar system simulation to solidify the use of basic Unity concepts. Planets include: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth (plus its moon), and Mars. Each planet rotates around both itself and the sun. All planets are clickable to rotate the camera view/focus. A mini map (second camera) is also included with a top overview of the solar system.
